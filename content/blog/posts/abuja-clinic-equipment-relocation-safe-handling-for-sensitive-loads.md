Medical and diagnostic equipment should never be moved like regular furniture.  
Even when the destination is close, handling quality matters more than distance.

This Abuja-focused guide is for clinics, labs, and health SMEs moving sensitive gear.

## Step 1: classify equipment sensitivity

Use three bands:

- high sensitivity: calibration-dependent devices
- medium sensitivity: powered support units
- low sensitivity: furniture and storage items

Do not mix all categories in one handling method.

## Step 2: assign handling leads

At minimum:

- one packing lead
- one loading verifier
- one receiving verifier

If nobody owns quality control, equipment risk rises immediately.

## Step 3: packaging and positioning rules

- protect controls and exposed panels
- secure movement gaps in crates/boxes
- place high sensitivity units in low-impact zones
- mark orientation clearly

## Step 4: receiving and validation

At destination:

1. verify item condition before full placement
2. log serial-sensitive equipment
3. confirm power compatibility and setup zone

This is where relocation quality becomes operational continuity.

## Common failure points

- rushed loading
- no item-level documentation
- no defined receiving process
- mixed handling for different sensitivity classes

## Clinic relocation action block

For clinics in Abuja, relocation success is measured by continuity of care and equipment integrity. Build a sequence that prioritizes critical units first and non-essential furniture later. Every sensitive unit should have a handling owner, a loading photo, and a destination verification check before commissioning.

Where possible, prepare destination power, positioning space, and cleaning access before the first item arrives. If your clinic serves daily patients, schedule in phases so front-desk function and basic consultation setup come online quickly while secondary rooms are completed afterward.
