Teams expanding across Lagos, Abuja, and Ibadan face one major challenge: inconsistent movement planning.  
Each city behaves differently, so one routine cannot fit all.

A city calendar aligns inventory, transport, and receiving operations.

## Build a city-level movement rhythm

Use weekly planning blocks:

- **Lagos:** high-priority, high-volume windows
- **Abuja:** structured estate/commercial slot planning
- **Ibadan:** market and campus-friendly transfer blocks

Your route plan should follow city behavior, not assumptions.

## Monthly planning template

Week 1:

- demand forecast + stock priority

Week 2:

- major bulk replenishment

Week 3:

- redistribution and balancing

Week 4:

- cleanup runs and reporting

This creates predictable logistics instead of reactive movement.

## Coordination rules for multi-city teams

- assign one city lead per location
- standardize load labeling across cities
- use the same update format for all trips
- run weekly exception review

Standard process lets leadership compare performance clearly.

## Core KPIs

- on-time arrival rate by city
- receiving error rate
- average load turnaround
- cost per completed movement

Multi-city growth becomes sustainable when these are tracked consistently.

## Multi-city execution action block

Running Lagos, Abuja, and Ibadan together requires a single planning language. Set one weekly planning day, one dispatch review day, and one performance review day across all cities. Keep your metrics aligned: on-time completion, failed handover rate, and cost variance per movement.

For expanding teams, define city leads with clear decision rights so route or window changes do not wait on central approval every time. Use one shared update rhythm for customer communication and internal handoff notes. Consistency in operations language is what makes multi-city growth predictable.
