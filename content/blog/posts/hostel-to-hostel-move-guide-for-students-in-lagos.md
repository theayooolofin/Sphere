If you've moved hostel before, you already know:  
it starts with "small load" and ends with six trips, missing items, and stress.

This guide is for students moving between hostels in Lagos.

## Step 1: pack by function, not by room

Students usually need quick setup at destination.

Create four bag/box groups:

- Sleep (bedding, nightwear, fan extension)
- School (laptop, notes, chargers, ID documents)
- Kitchen/feeding basics
- Clothing and extras

When you arrive, setup becomes simple.

## Step 2: set a strict budget cap

Before booking, define:

- target transport budget
- maximum extra spend
- emergency buffer

Budget control helps you avoid panic spending during move day.

## Step 3: protect high-value items

- Keep laptop and phone with you, not deep in the load
- Use smaller protected bag for documents
- Wrap mirrors, small electronics, and glass
- Label boxes with your name and destination room

Small prevention saves replacement money.

## Step 4: coordinate with hostel timing

Confirm:

- gate access hours
- weekend restrictions
- unloading policy
- any movement fee requirements

Most student delays happen at the gate, not on the road.

## Step 5: choose smart timing

Early movement gives you:

- better route flexibility
- easier room setup
- less crowd pressure

Late-evening student moves usually feel harder than they need to be.

## Common student move mistakes

- Packing everything the same morning
- No label system
- No receiver at destination
- Ignoring hostel move rules

Do the basics and your move becomes manageable.

## Fast student move checklist

1. Pack by function
2. Budget cap set
3. High-value items separated
4. Hostel timing confirmed
5. Contact person ready at drop-off
