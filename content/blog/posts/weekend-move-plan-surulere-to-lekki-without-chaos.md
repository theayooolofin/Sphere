Most Lagos moves fail for one reason: people start too late.  
By Saturday morning, they are still buying tape, calling random transport providers, and arguing about what should have been packed on Friday.

If you're moving from Surulere, Yaba, Ikeja, or anywhere on the mainland to Lekki, Ajah, or Chevron axis, this is the practical plan that works.

## Friday evening: setup, not panic

Use Friday to remove decision fatigue from Saturday.

- List your **must-move** items first: documents, chargers, medications, work laptop
- Pack non-essentials early: decor, extra shoes, books, kitchen backups
- Label by room: bedroom, kitchen, living room, bathroom
- Separate what is not moving: giveaway, trash, storage

If your packing is still "half-open boxes" by 10pm Friday, Saturday will be expensive.

## Saturday early morning: heavy lifting window

In Lagos, your best moving window is usually early morning.

- Confirm your driver and vehicle before 7:00am
- Share correct pickup pin and a nearby landmark
- Confirm destination gate access and floor details
- Keep one person at pickup and one at drop-off if possible

This is where [choosing the right vehicle size](https://www.sphere.ng/blog.html) saves you from second trips.

## Pack by weight zone

Don't load random boxes in random order.

- Bottom layer: heavy items (books, tools, cookware)
- Middle: medium cartons and durable appliances
- Top: fragile items and soft bags
- Separate lane: breakables, mirrors, screens

For fragile protection, use this guide:

## Your Lagos-specific move checklist

- Building security informed at pickup
- Building security informed at drop-off
- Elevator/stair access confirmed
- Two extension cords and one power strip packed separately
- One overnight bag packed outside the main load
- Cash and transfer options ready for minor building fees

These small details are usually what delay completion.

## What to do after arrival

Don't try to "arrange the whole house" in one day.

Day one priority:

1. Power + internet setup
2. Bed setup
3. Bathroom essentials
4. Cooking basics
5. Workstation corner

Everything else can wait.

## Common mistakes that waste money

- Booking too late and accepting any price
- Underestimating volume and requiring extra trips
- Packing fragile items with no padding
- No labels, so unloading becomes a guessing game

None of these are complex issues. They are planning issues.

## Final word

A clean Lagos weekend move is not about luck. It is about sequence.
When you handle Friday prep well, Saturday execution becomes simple and Sunday becomes recovery, not regret.
