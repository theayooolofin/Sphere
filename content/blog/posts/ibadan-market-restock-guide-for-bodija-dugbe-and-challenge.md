Ibadan merchants often lose margin through unplanned restocking.  
You buy late, move late, and still miss the highest-demand window.

If your stock moves between Bodija, Dugbe, and Challenge, your logistics should run like a schedule, not a reaction.

## Weekly structure that works

- Monday: fast-moving SKU check
- Tuesday: supplier confirmation
- Wednesday: main bulk transfer
- Friday: top-up for weekend demand

A stable rhythm beats emergency purchases.

## Sort products by movement urgency

Create three tiers:

- **Daily movers:** must not stock out
- **Frequent movers:** restock twice weekly
- **Slow movers:** scheduled monthly

The goal is to move volume where turnover justifies it.

## Packaging rules for market stock

- Pack by category, not by supplier
- Keep fragile items separate
- Label destination shelf section
- Use clear carton counts for receiving team

If receiving cannot sort fast, your sales floor suffers.

## Route batching tips

When pickups are nearby, combine movements in one trip plan.  
Multi-stop clarity helps drivers estimate accurately and reduces confusion at handover.

## KPI set for shop owners

Track weekly:

- stockout count
- emergency-trip count
- average restock turnaround
- logistics cost vs sales

This gives you control over inventory movement decisions.

## Ibadan action block

If you run a shop around Bodija, Dugbe, or Challenge, pick one fixed restock day and protect it.

Do this each week:

1. lock fast-moving SKU quantity by Tuesday
2. finalize supplier confirmations
3. dispatch in one structured bulk lane
4. reconcile received stock same day

Merchants who keep this rhythm usually reduce emergency restocks and protect margins better.  
Your goal is fewer surprises, cleaner shelves, and predictable movement cost.
