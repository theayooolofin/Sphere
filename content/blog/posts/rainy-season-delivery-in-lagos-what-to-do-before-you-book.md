Rain changes move behavior in Lagos fast.  
Road speed drops, loading takes longer, and packaging failures show up immediately.

If you move items in rainy season without planning, you're not unlucky, you're exposed.

## Step 1: upgrade packaging for water risk

Standard carton alone is not enough in wet weather.

- Use plastic wraps outside boxes
- Tape edges twice
- Elevate fragile cartons away from wet floors
- Separate electronics from all liquid items

Water damage is usually a packaging decision made before pickup.

## Step 2: confirm access conditions

Before booking, confirm:

- Is the pickup street waterlogged?
- Can the vehicle park close to your gate?
- Is there shelter for temporary staging?
- Is someone available at drop-off to receive quickly?

Rain delays get worse when there is no receiving plan.

## Step 3: pad your timeline

In rainy season, don't plan to the minute.

- Add extra time between pickup and arrival
- Avoid stacking multiple risky appointments
- Share flexible windows with recipients

Expectation management is part of good logistics.

## Step 4: add clear in-app instructions

Your request notes should include:

- number of fragile boxes
- no-water-exposure warning
- call-before-arrival instruction
- exact drop-off landmark

Clear notes reduce confusion when weather conditions are already difficult.

## Step 5: choose item priority for rainy days

Split movement into:

- **must move today**
- **can move when weather improves**

Moving everything in one wet window increases breakage risk.

## Common rainy-season mistakes

- Relying on thin nylon alone
- Ignoring access flood risk
- No receiver at destination
- Overloading trips to "finish once"

Smarter is usually slower but safer.

## Fast rainy-day checklist

1. Water-resistant wrapping done
2. Fragile items separated
3. Pickup and drop access confirmed
4. Timeline padded
5. Driver notes included in request

Do these five and your rainy-season move success rate improves significantly.
