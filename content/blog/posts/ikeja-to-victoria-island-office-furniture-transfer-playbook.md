When offices move from Ikeja to Victoria Island, downtime is the hidden cost.  
The move itself may be one day, but productivity losses can stretch for a week.

This playbook helps small and mid-sized teams transfer furniture and equipment with minimal interruption.

## Phase 1: pre-move audit

List assets in three groups:

- work-critical (desks in use, monitors, network tools)
- important but non-critical (cabinet units, extra chairs)
- storage/archived items

Tag each item before move day.

## Phase 2: loading strategy

- load archived/non-critical items first
- keep critical tools last-in for first-out unloading
- separate fragile office electronics
- assign one person to verify counts

A clean load order reduces setup time at destination.

## Phase 3: destination setup order

1. Internet and power lines
2. Core workstations
3. Team communication zone
4. Remaining furniture arrangement

Do not start with decoration and layout aesthetics.

## Risk-control notes

- Photograph cable and equipment states before departure
- Keep client-facing devices in protected cartons
- Confirm building service access timing
- Keep facility contact available during unloading

## One-day vs two-day method

If your team is under 15 people, one structured day can work.  
For larger setups with many dependencies, split into two days and protect operations.

## Lagos business action block

For Ikeja-to-VI office moves, run a command-style move brief:

- one move lead
- one tech lead
- one receiving lead
- one fallback communication channel

Prepare a "first 2 hours" list that covers internet, workstations, and admin desk setup.  
This prevents half-day productivity loss and keeps client-facing teams active quickly.

Where possible, move archive and non-critical furniture first, then move active workstations in a controlled final batch.
