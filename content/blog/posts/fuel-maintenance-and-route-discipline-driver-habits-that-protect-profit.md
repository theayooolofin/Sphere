Some drivers complete many trips and still feel broke at week end.  
The issue is not always demand. It's operational leakage.

Profit is what remains after fuel waste, avoidable repairs, and idle gaps.

## Habit 1: track fuel per day, not by memory

Write down:

- opening fuel level
- daily top-up amount
- closing fuel level
- trips completed

After two weeks, patterns become visible.

## Habit 2: run weekly vehicle checks

Do a quick weekly checklist:

- tire pressure
- brake feel
- engine oil level
- lights and indicators
- suspension noises

Small checks prevent expensive roadside breakdowns.

## Habit 3: avoid route guesswork

Before high-effort trips:

- review route alternatives
- identify likely bottlenecks
- confirm drop-off access notes

Route clarity protects both time and fuel.

## Habit 4: reduce idle engine time

Long idle periods burn money silently.

- switch off during long waits where safe
- coordinate pickup to reduce stand-by time
- ask customers to stage loads before arrival

Idle control can materially change weekly profit.

## Habit 5: protect your service quality

Better communication = faster decisions = lower delays.

- confirm ETA early
- report delay quickly
- clarify load size before arrival

Professionalism helps you attract better requests.

## Habit 6: keep simple weekly numbers

Track:

- total payout
- fuel spend
- maintenance spend
- net weekly margin

If you don't track, you can't optimize.

## Habit 7: build a monthly repair reserve

Set aside a fixed percentage weekly for maintenance reserve.  
Emergency repairs become manageable when budgeted.
