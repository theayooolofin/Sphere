For many Instagram vendors, sales are not the main problem.  
Move consistency is.

Customers remember two things: move speed and communication quality.  
If both fail, repeat purchase drops.

## Rule 1: never dispatch without full address validation

Before handover, confirm:

- full name
- active phone number
- exact drop-off landmark
- preferred move window

"Send location" alone is not enough.

## Rule 2: use dispatch batches

Group same-axis orders instead of one-by-one dispatch chaos.

- Mainland cluster
- Island cluster
- Urgent single order lane

Batching reduces errors and improves daily throughput.

## Rule 3: separate payment status clearly

Tag every order:

- paid
- part-paid
- pay-on-completion

This prevents handover disputes and accounting confusion.

## Rule 4: package for movement, not shelf display

Pretty packaging is good, but move-safe packaging is better.

- seal liquids well
- protect fragile items
- keep invoice inside
- attach external order ID label

A clean packaging process reduces customer complaints fast.

## Rule 5: send proactive customer updates

Update buyer on:

- dispatch time
- driver en route
- move completed

Silence creates anxiety and unnecessary support messages.

## Rule 6: keep a failed-move protocol

When a move fails, follow a process:

1. call customer twice
2. log reason
3. reschedule or return stock
4. update customer channel immediately

No protocol means profit leaks.

## Rule 7: track weekly fulfillment metrics

Minimum dashboard:

- orders dispatched
- successful first-attempt moves
- failed move reasons
- average dispatch-to-move completion time

What gets measured gets improved.
