Small teams cannot afford chaotic office moves.  
One broken monitor or one lost router can freeze productivity for days.

This 2-day checklist is designed for Lagos teams under 20 people.

## Day 1: prep and labeling

Assign one move lead and one backup.  
Then label everything in three groups:

- **Critical day-one**: routers, laptops, extension boards, admin files
- **Operational**: desks, chairs, printers, shelves
- **Non-urgent**: decor, archived files, extras

Use clear tags per department: admin, product, sales, operations.

## Day 1 evening: tech and data safeguards

Before any physical move:

- backup shared files
- photograph current cable setups
- pack routers and adapters in one marked box
- pack one emergency office kit (chargers, tape, markers)

Most office move delays are tech setup delays.

## Day 2 morning: controlled loading

Don't mix critical and non-critical items.

Loading order:

1. Non-urgent furniture
2. Operational equipment
3. Critical day-one kit (last in, first out)

This helps you start work quickly even before full setup is done.

## Arrival sequence at new office

First 90 minutes should focus on business continuity:

- internet and power
- core workstations
- finance and admin desk
- team communication channel reset

After that, proceed with furniture arrangement.

## Common office move errors

- no ownership of move coordination
- unlabeled shared equipment
- no cable documentation
- no priority unpacking order

These are process failures, not logistics failures.

## Minimal downtime checklist

- Team informed of timeline
- Key assets packed and tagged
- Internet setup owner assigned
- One emergency work zone ready
- Post-move validation done by team lead
