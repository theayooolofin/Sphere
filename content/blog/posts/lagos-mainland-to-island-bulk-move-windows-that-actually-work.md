Bulk moves in Lagos are won or lost on timing.  
The same route can feel easy at one hour and unworkable two hours later.

If you are moving from Yaba, Surulere, Ikeja, Maryland, or Ikorodu side to Lekki, Victoria Island, or Ajah corridor, you need a window-first plan.

## Why timing beats speed in Lagos

Most customers ask, "How fast can we move?"  
The better question is, "What window reduces stoppage, idle waiting, and extra handling?"

For bulk moves, delays create:

- higher stress for handlers
- longer unload queues at destination
- risk to fragile or stacked goods

## Window planning model

Use three planning buckets:

- **Primary window:** your best-case movement time
- **Fallback window:** second option if prep runs late
- **No-go window:** heavy-congestion periods you avoid on purpose

This structure prevents panic decisions on move day.

## Pre-move items to lock in

Before booking, confirm:

- exact pickup floor and access notes
- unloading person at destination
- building gate protocol
- item count finalization before driver arrival

Good timing with poor preparation still fails.

## Practical corridor rule

If your move involves bridge-dependent corridors, reduce complexity:

- fewer split drops
- better labeling
- clean loading order

When route pressure is high, operational simplicity wins.

## What successful customers do differently

- They pack before the driver arrives
- They keep one move lead on each side
- They send complete location notes, not vague descriptions
- They separate fragile and high-value items early

## Final checklist

1. Primary and fallback windows selected
2. Access constraints documented
3. Load sequence prepared
4. Receiver available at drop-off

That combination is what makes a mainland-to-island bulk move feel controlled.

## Lagos action block

If your move is within the next 72 hours, run this mini-brief before you request:

- pickup landmark and building notes
- destination receiver and gate instruction
- fragile/priority item list
- preferred movement window + fallback window

Then submit one clear request instead of multiple incomplete requests.  
In Lagos, complete briefs get better-quality bids because drivers can estimate properly.

For teams moving office or store inventory, assign one operations lead to own communication end-to-end.  
That one decision reduces avoidable delays more than any last-minute bargaining.
