Everybody wants a cheaper move.  
The mistake is trying to cut cost at the wrong stage.

When customers cut the wrong thing, they pay twice later through breakage, delays, or extra trips.

## Where moving costs actually come from

In Lagos, most move costs come from:

- Vehicle mismatch (too small or too big)
- Time loss at pickup or drop-off
- Poor packing quality
- Unclear directions and gate access delays

If you optimize these four, cost drops naturally.

## Cost saver #1: right-size your trip

If your load cannot fit safely, don't force it.  
Multiple emergency trips usually cost more than one properly sized trip.

Use this as your base:

- Small loads: compact car
- Medium household/shop load: van
- Large move: medium truck

## Cost saver #2: reduce idle time

Drivers bill for movement effort, but delays increase total pricing pressure.

Before pickup:

- Pack fully before driver arrival
- Bring items downstairs where possible
- Inform security in advance
- Keep destination contact reachable

Thirty minutes of avoidable waiting can change your final spend.

## Cost saver #3: pack once, pack well

Damage is expensive. Replacements are more expensive.

- Wrap fragile items
- Fill empty gaps in cartons
- Label breakables clearly
- Keep electronics upright

## Cost saver #4: avoid peak chaos windows

Lagos traffic patterns affect efficiency.  
If your timing is flexible, choose cleaner windows and avoid gridlock where possible.

Less traffic means:

- faster turnaround
- lower stress
- fewer unload delays

## Cost saver #5: combine related movements

If you have two nearby pickups, plan one route instead of separate unplanned requests.  
Route clarity improves bidding quality and usually lowers total spend.

## "Cheap" mistakes that become expensive

- Choosing a bid with no clear communication
- Hiding actual load size
- Skipping fragile protection
- Forgetting destination access constraints

Transparent details produce better, fairer pricing.

## Final checklist before booking

- Final item count complete
- Vehicle type confirmed
- Pickup/drop details clear
- Fragile handling instructions added
- Contact persons confirmed

Cost control in logistics is mostly discipline, not luck.
