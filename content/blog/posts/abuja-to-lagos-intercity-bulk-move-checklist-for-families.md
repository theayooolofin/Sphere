Intercity moves fail when families treat them like city moves.  
Abuja-to-Lagos transfer needs stricter sequencing, cleaner inventory records, and realistic timing.

This checklist is designed for full or near-full household movement.

## Step 1: split your load by urgency

Use two lanes:

- **Lane A (critical first 24h):** documents, bedding, medications, key electronics
- **Lane B (full household):** furniture, appliances, non-urgent items

Lane A should be easy to access immediately at destination.

## Step 2: create item proof before loading

- photo major items
- count cartons by category
- tag special-handling pieces
- store item list on phone and printed copy

Intercity clarity reduces stress at arrival.

## Step 3: secure fragile and high-value zones

- use layered wraps for glass/screen items
- separate high-value electronics
- keep critical paperwork with family lead

Bulk moves are stable when load zones are clearly defined.

## Step 4: arrival-day priorities in Lagos

1. Power, sleep, and bathroom setup
2. Essential kitchen access
3. Work/school setup items
4. Full arrangement later

The first day is for functionality, not perfection.

## Common intercity mistakes

- no inventory proof
- no lane separation for urgent items
- overloading with poor structure
- unrealistic arrival expectations

A structured checklist prevents most of these.

## Intercity family action block

If you are planning a household transfer from Abuja to Lagos, decide your *arrival function* first: are you resuming school, work, or setting up temporary housing? That one decision should control your packing order and your unloading order. Keep first-night essentials (documents, chargers, school/work clothing, medication, toiletries) in a separate labeled bundle that is not mixed with bulk boxes.

For Abuja departures, lock your estate gate schedule and loading window before move day. For Lagos arrivals, use a realistic handover window and avoid planning final setup during peak-hour traffic periods. For family moves with children, prepare the first room end-to-end on arrival before opening every box; this reduces stress and keeps the day controlled.
