Night moves are useful, especially for busy schedules and urgent movements.  
But night operations need better communication discipline than daytime trips.

This playbook keeps both customers and drivers safer.

## For customers: prep before pickup

Before your request goes live:

- share exact pickup and drop landmarks
- ensure phone is reachable
- confirm who will receive at destination
- avoid vague instructions like "near the gate"

At night, ambiguity creates delay and tension.

## For customers: reduce handover risk

- Keep transactions in visible areas
- Avoid isolated transfer points where possible
- Confirm item count before departure
- Share package details clearly in-app

Clarity prevents disputes.

## For drivers: communication first

Night success is usually communication quality:

- call before arrival
- give brief status updates
- confirm recipient identity at drop-off
- avoid assumption-based rerouting

Professional communication is a safety tool.

## Route and timing discipline

- Use known major roads where possible
- avoid unnecessary stopovers
- update ETA if conditions change
- close the trip only after confirmed handover

## If there is a disagreement

Do not escalate emotionally.

1. Pause movement
2. Restate trip details calmly
3. Document issue in-app
4. Contact support if needed

Process beats argument.

## Night-move red flags

- Inconsistent pickup details
- No reachable destination contact
- Last-minute route changes with no explanation
- Pressure to bypass platform process

If anything feels wrong, escalate early.

## Quick night operations checklist

- Landmarks confirmed
- Contact numbers active
- Item summary clear
- Handover person identified
- Support path known

Reliable night logistics is built, not guessed.
