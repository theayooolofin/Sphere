SME owners often try to move all stock in one high-pressure run.  
That usually increases confusion, losses, and receiving overload.

A two-trip strategy gives better control when moving inventory from Ibadan to Abuja.

## Trip model

- **Trip 1:** fast-moving and revenue-critical stock
- **Trip 2:** secondary and slower-turn inventory

This protects cash flow while reducing receiving chaos.

## Pre-dispatch controls

- count by SKU group
- tag by destination shelf/zone
- separate fragile and heavy cartons
- prepare receiving checklist in Abuja

Inventory clarity should exist before loading, not after arrival.

## Receiving team structure

At destination, assign:

- one count verifier
- one shelf placement lead
- one discrepancy logger

Without role assignment, stock errors grow fast.

## Why two trips often win

- lower load stress
- cleaner receiving process
- less confusion around urgent items
- better reporting after each stage

A staged strategy is operationally stronger for most SMEs.

## SME transfer action block

For SMEs moving stock from Ibadan to Abuja, the strongest model is controlled staging instead of one overloaded dispatch. Use Trip 1 for fast-moving SKUs and launch inventory, then Trip 2 for reserve stock and slower lines. This keeps sales active at destination while remaining stock is in transit.

Before dispatch, lock carton labels by category and quantity, then assign one receiver to count by manifest on arrival. Avoid mixed cartons that combine unrelated SKUs. Clean category labeling and two-step transfer flow usually reduce shrinkage risk and speed up shelf readiness.
