Most small retailers don't have a sales problem.  
They have a **restock rhythm** problem.

When restocking is random, three things happen quickly: stockouts, emergency purchases, and margin leakage.

## Build a weekly restock rhythm

Use a fixed weekly structure:

- Monday: fast movers review
- Tuesday: supplier confirmation
- Wednesday: main pickup and transfer
- Friday: top-up for weekend demand

Consistency beats improvisation.

## Separate products by urgency

Create three tiers:

- **Tier A**: daily fast sellers (must never stock out)
- **Tier B**: steady sellers (review twice weekly)
- **Tier C**: slow sellers (monthly or promotional restock)

Move Tier A on predictable windows, not "when we notice."

## Use route batching

If your suppliers are in nearby zones, batch pickups in one route.

Example:

- Supplier cluster on mainland
- Drop to one micro-hub
- Final movement to your store

This reduces per-trip friction and keeps operations calmer.

## Keep your request notes clean

Drivers work better with clear instructions:

- carton count
- fragile/keep-upright items
- pickup contact name
- gate access notes
- unloading support availability

The clearer your request, the better your bids.

## Track your restock KPI set

You do not need complex software to improve.

Track weekly:

- stockout events
- emergency trip count
- average restock turnaround
- logistics spend as % of revenue

If stockouts drop while spend stays stable, your system is improving.

## Mistakes that hurt SME growth

- Restocking only when shelves are empty
- No item prioritization
- One-person logistics dependency
- No documented process for assistants

If your process depends on one person remembering everything, it will fail under pressure.

## Simple weekly operating template

1. 30-min Monday stock review
2. Supplier list finalized same day
3. Mid-week core transfer
4. Friday demand top-up
5. Saturday metrics review

This alone can stabilize move operations in under a month.
