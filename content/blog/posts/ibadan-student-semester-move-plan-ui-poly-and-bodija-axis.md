Student moves in Ibadan often look small but become bulky quickly.  
Books, bedding, kitchen sets, fan units, and boxes add up faster than expected.

A semester move should be planned as a proper bulk transfer, not a last-minute scramble.

## What to do 48 hours before move day

- sort items by usage: immediate vs later
- keep exam/work tools separate
- pre-pack non-urgent boxes
- label by destination room or zone

This removes pressure on actual move morning.

## Load groups for student moves

- **Group 1:** essentials for first night
- **Group 2:** school and work items
- **Group 3:** bulky lifestyle items
- **Group 4:** fragile pieces

Use this sequence to avoid losing important items inside bigger boxes.

## Timing guidance

Start early and avoid stacked appointments on move day.  
Student buildings can have sudden access restrictions that delay unloading.

Always confirm:

- gate access
- floor access
- receiving contact

## Budget and stress control

Create a simple move budget with:

- transport spend
- small supplies (tape/wrap)
- contingency buffer

When budget is set, decisions are cleaner.

## Student action block

For student moves in Ibadan, your main win is speed of setup, not just transport. Pack by *first 24 hours*, *first week*, and *rest of semester*. First-24-hour items should include bedding, one cooking set, toiletries, power extension, and essential documents. This prevents late-night buying runs after arrival.

For UI/Poly routes and Bodija-adjacent housing, avoid late loading where possible and keep your heaviest bags in one grouped zone for faster handling. If roommates are moving together, use color tags per person before loading so unpacking does not become a sorting project at destination.
