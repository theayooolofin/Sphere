Most move conflicts are not fraud.  
They are communication failures under pressure.

When a trip starts going wrong, people react emotionally and things worsen fast.  
This guide gives both customers and drivers a process that works.

## The 5-minute reset rule

If there is a serious disagreement:

1. Pause movement safely
2. Restate current facts only
3. Confirm expected outcome
4. Document timestamp and status

This lowers tension and avoids impulsive decisions.

## For customers: what to do first

- Stay specific: item count, current location, expected ETA
- Avoid personal accusations in early stage
- Confirm if issue is delay, handling, or destination access
- Keep records in one chat thread

Clear communication gets faster resolution than emotional escalation.

## For drivers: what to do first

- Provide location and clear status update
- Explain delay cause and revised ETA
- Confirm load condition if concern is damage
- Ask for destination reconfirmation if unclear

Silence is usually interpreted as negligence.

## Common conflict scenarios and responses

### Scenario A: late arrival

- Share revised ETA
- Explain bottleneck clearly
- Offer realistic next action

### Scenario B: item concern at drop-off

- Pause handover
- Check item with customer present
- Document condition
- Escalate through support channel if needed

### Scenario C: wrong destination details

- Reconfirm full address
- Share additional distance implication
- Continue only after both parties agree

## What not to do

- Threaten cancellation without process
- Move off-platform during active issue
- Use vague updates ("coming soon", "almost there") repeatedly
- Ignore calls/messages for long periods

These behaviors increase dispute severity.

## A better closure process

At move completion:

- Confirm item handover
- Confirm issue resolved or escalated
- Close with short recap message

Professional closure protects reputation on both sides.

## Why this matters

Trust compounds in logistics.  
A market where both customers and drivers follow process gets faster, safer, and more profitable over time.
