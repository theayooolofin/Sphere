Choosing the right vehicle is one of the most important decisions when planning a move in Lagos. If you pick a vehicle that is too small, you may pay for multiple trips. If you pick one that is too large, you may spend more than necessary.

This guide helps you match your load to the right Sphere option so your move is faster, safer, and more cost-effective.

## Step 1: Start with your load type

Before selecting any vehicle, group your items into three categories:

- **Light and compact**: clothing, small boxes, documents, electronics in small quantity
- **Bulky household items**: mattress, fridge, washing machine, TV console, packed furniture
- **Heavy or high-volume commercial goods**: shop inventory, office equipment, large cartons in bulk

Your load type usually tells you what vehicle class to start with.

## Step 2: Use Sphere's vehicle options correctly

On Sphere, most customer moves fit one of these:

- **Compact Car**: best for small loads and short-distance transfers
- **Van**: suitable for bulky home items and moderate business moves
- **Medium Truck**: ideal for large house moves or high-volume goods

If your load includes multiple bulky appliances and furniture, start with a van or medium truck. For quick, low-volume movement, compact car is usually enough.

## Step 3: Estimate volume, not just weight

Most customers focus only on weight, but **space** is often the limiting factor. A load can be light but still occupy too much room.

Use this quick check:

- Count the number of large items (wardrobe, mattress, freezer, generator)
- Count the number of medium cartons
- Note extra shape-heavy items (chairs, tables, stands)

If your items cannot stack safely, you need more cargo space.

## Step 4: Consider distance and road conditions

Lagos traffic and road access affect the best choice:

- For short intra-city trips with small loads, compact options can work well.
- For longer routes or multi-stop move, a vehicle with more space reduces handling and delays.
- For areas with tighter street access, discuss pickup/drop-off details before accepting a bid.

Always include landmarks and access notes in your request to avoid last-minute issues.

## Step 5: Protect fragile items

Vehicle size alone does not guarantee safe move. Add basic protection:

- Wrap glass and screens
- Label fragile cartons clearly
- Keep electronics upright when possible
- Separate heavy items from delicate ones

A proper load arrangement can prevent damage and reduce disputes.

## Step 6: Compare bids with context

When bids come in, don't choose by price alone. Review:

- Driver ETA
- Vehicle suitability for your exact load
- Communication quality
- Any handling notes from the driver

The best bid is the one that matches your move risk, timeline, and budget.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Underestimating item volume
- Ignoring fragile handling requirements
- Choosing the cheapest bid without checking fit
- Leaving out pickup/drop-off access details

Each of these can increase cost and delay completion.

## Final checklist before you book

- Confirm item list and quantity
- Confirm correct vehicle type
- Add fragile labels and access notes
- Review bids beyond price
- Confirm contact availability at pickup and drop-off

When this checklist is complete, your move is usually smoother from start to finish.

## Need help choosing quickly?

If you're unsure between options, start your request on Sphere and include a clear item summary. That gives drivers enough detail to send more accurate bids.
