Fragile-item damage is one of the biggest avoidable causes of move complaints. In Lagos, traffic, sudden stops, poor stacking, and rushed loading all increase breakage risk if packaging is weak.

This guide gives you a practical standard that works for same-day and next-day movement.

## Step 1: Group items by breakability level

Do not pack everything as one class. Sort items first:

- **High risk**: glass, mirrors, ceramics, framed items, TV screens
- **Medium risk**: kitchen appliances, printers, desktop monitors
- **Low risk**: clothing, pillows, plastic containers

High-risk items should never share direct pressure zones with medium or low-risk loads.

## Step 2: Use a 3-layer protection rule

For high-risk items, apply three layers:

1. **Surface wrap**: soft cloth or bubble wrap directly on the item
2. **Shock layer**: foam sheet, corrugated board, or thick paper wrap
3. **Outer carton support**: double-wall carton with side padding

If one layer fails during impact, the next layer still protects the item.

## Step 3: Reinforce corners and edges

Corners absorb impact first. Add corner guards for:

- TV and monitor edges
- glass table corners
- framed artwork

Use wide tape bands on both vertical and horizontal seams. Weak seam tape is a common failure point.

## Step 4: Fill carton voids correctly

Never leave empty spaces inside fragile cartons. Use filler materials such as:

- crumpled kraft paper
- foam peanuts
- air pillows

When cartons have internal movement, items collide and crack during turns or speed bumps.

## Step 5: Label for handling behavior

Each fragile carton should include clear labels on at least two sides:

- FRAGILE
- THIS SIDE UP
- DO NOT STACK

Labels are not enough by themselves, but they improve load behavior when combined with correct packing.

## Step 6: Match packaging to the right vehicle

Even excellent packaging can fail in the wrong vehicle setup. Before posting your request, choose the vehicle based on both size and vibration exposure.

If you need help with that decision, use this guide first:

## Step 7: Add pickup and drop-off handling notes

Inside your request notes, include:

- number of fragile boxes
- specific high-risk items
- preferred stacking instructions
- who will supervise loading/unloading

This reduces assumptions and creates cleaner driver-customer alignment.

## Common packing mistakes that cause damage

- Using single-layer wraps for glass items
- Mixing heavy metal objects with fragile cartons
- Overfilling boxes until seams deform
- Skipping drop-off handling instructions

Most "unexpected" breakages come from one of these four mistakes.

## Quick fragile-move checklist

- Separate high-risk items from regular cartons
- Apply the 3-layer rule
- Protect corners and seams
- Fill all internal void spaces
- Label clearly and add handling notes in-app
- Choose vehicle based on item volume and risk

When these are done properly, your move arrives with fewer incidents and fewer dispute cycles.
